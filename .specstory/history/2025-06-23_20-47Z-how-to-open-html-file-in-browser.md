To view your `andromeda.html` file in your browser, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the File**:  
   Go to the folder where your `andromeda.html` file is saved. In your case, it's at:  
   `C:\Users\Mariano\Desktop\newBalerina\andromeda.html`

2. **Open with Browser**:  
   - Right-click on the `andromeda.html` file.
   - Select **Open with** and then choose your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

3. **Alternative Method**:  
   - Open your web browser.
   - Press `Ctrl+O` (or go to File > Open File).
   - Browse to `C:\Users\Mariano\Desktop\newBalerina\andromeda.html` and open it.

This will display your storyboard app in the browser, and you can interact with it as intended.

If you want to make changes and see them live, just refresh the browser after saving your edits to the HTML file. If you need to access it from another device or want a local server (for advanced features), let me know and I can guide you through that as well!
